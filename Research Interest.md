# Research Interest

The brain is a remarkably complex organ, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to unravel its mysteries. Various disorders, such as intellectual developmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain cancers, have intricate connections with neuroscience, underscoring the importance of understanding and controlling brain functions. I began my journey of brain exploration by recognizing its complexity and experiencing various methods to study it.

**Complexity in interneurons.** Since the time of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, neuron classification has remained a fundamental area of study in neurobiology. Today, we are empowered by various advanced tools that allow us to observe neurons in greater detail. We can examine their morphology to understand structural differences, study their physiology to learn about their functional properties, and analyze their molecular expression to uncover genetic and biochemical characteristics. These modern techniques enhance our ability to classify and understand the diverse types of neurons within the brain.

In our project focused on classifying VIP+ interneurons ([Shao-Na Jiang, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhac343), [Poster](https://zhouying0818.github.io/zying_blog/personal_doc/Poster_Sncg_Mybpc1_and_Parm1_Classify_subpopulations_of_VIP-expressing_interneurons%20_n_layers_23_of.pdf) ), I constructed quantification methods for analyzing the morphology and electrophysiology of neurons (Figure 1A-D) and employed various computational methods to analyze their subtypes (Figure 1F-G). During this research, I thoroughly recognized the complexity of neurons and generated a question: **What promotes them to form such complicated features?**

**Neural stem/progenitor cells possess the remarkable ability to generate the complex features of neurons and glia.** These cells undergo various stages of differentiation and specialization, giving rise to the diverse cell types that contribute to the intricate structure and function of the brain (Figure 2A). Understanding the mechanisms that guide their development is crucial for unraveling the complexities of neural architecture and addressing neurological disorders.

In my previous project on the development of the ferret’s gyrus ([Poster](https://zhouying0818.github.io/zying_blog/personal_doc/Poster_ Effects_of_Cell_Cycle_and_migration_on_Cortical_Folding_During_Brain_Development_in_ferret.pdf)), I labeled types of neural stem/progenitor cells and analyzed their differentiation and cell cycle across the gyrus and sulcus regions. This work highlighted the remarkable power of neural progenitors and indicated that exist molecular programme regulating their activity (migration, proliferation and differentiation). While we could not label truncated RGC (tRG), an interesting subtype of radial glial cell (RGC), I learned about them from other published papers, which greatly attracted me. Unlike other neural cells that migrate outward, tRGs truncate their basal process at a particular developmental timeline (Figure 2B). This unique behavior fascinated me and left a strong impression. 

Additionally, I learned about a spectrum of diseases linked to cortical malformations, such as pachygyria, from the results of former researchers in this project and my following experience in a hospital-based research platform. Disruptions in cell proliferation, neuronal migration, and postmigrational cortical organization can all result in varied cortical morphologies associated with functional disorders, such as epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism. These findings underscore that neural stem cells (NSCs) are a vital focus for understanding the brain and developing new treatments for related disorders.

 **NSC not only exist in the fetal brain.** It's imperative to distinguish between fetal NSCs (fNSCs) and adult NSCs (aNSCs). fNSCs exhibit widespread inside-out multi-layer cellular structures within the fetal brain, whereas aNSCs are primarily located in a dormant state within the subgranular zone (SGZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ) (Figure 2B), becoming activated in response to particular stimuli, such as injury [(Noelia Urbán et al. 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.09.026).

**There are potential links between NSCs and GSCs.** During my bioinformatics Master's study, I learned about a group of tumor cells in glioblastoma (GBM) that possess the ability to enter a quiescent state and generate various progenies when activated, known as GBM stem cells (GSC). This inspired me to question the relationship between NSCs and GSCs, as well as their corresponding lineages. Therefore, I designed my thesis project that Systematic comparison of GBM and neurodevelopmental trajectories in my bioinformatics Master. I Integrated and analyzed 5 GBM single-cell/single-nucleus transcriptome datasets, and aligned these datasets with developmental trajectories observed in fetus to systematically compare. The result of tRG showing multiple activation pathways associated with cilia, notably evident in fetal data and broadly activated in GBM (fig), drawn my attention.

When I searched related papers, I gained experiment-validated points: 1)  GBMs have been observed to invade the ventricular region, cells in the SVZ secreting factors attracting GBC towards them (Figure 2C, [(Qin et al. 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.016)); 2)a subset of aNSC expressing markers similar to RGC in GBM [(Wang et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.01.007).  aNSC also shares morphological similarities with tRG (only have apical process, Figure 2B); 3) tRGs generate a significant portion of ependymal cells [(Bilgic et al. 2022)](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.91406) that sharing an origin with aNSC [(Ortiz-Álvarez et al. 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.01.051). 

Given that three hypotheses emerge regarding their origin: 1) mature cells adopting stem-like properties (dashed line in Figure 2A), 2) abnormal differentiation of activated aNSC in response to stimuli (Figure2 D), or 3) a combination of the two, wherein mature cells trigger an inflammatory response, activating quiescent aNSC, leading to abnormal differentiation into tumor cells (personal hypothesis, Figure 2E).

**Figure 2: Potential GBCs, Fetal, and Adult Neural Stem Cell Relationships**

Overall, I am curious in four questions: 1) Can tRG transition into dormant aNSC residing in the SVZ of adult animals? 2) Is there a mechanism linking aNSC to the generation of GSC? 3) Do GBCs also enter a quiescent state similar to aNSC, and if so, what molecules are involved and how might this relate to recurrence? 4) Can the mechanism for reverting active aNSC back to quiescence and inhibit GBM progression?
