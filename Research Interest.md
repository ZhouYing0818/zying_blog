# Research Interest

The brain is a remarkably complex organ, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to unravel its mysteries. Various disorders, such as intellectual developmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain cancers, have intricate connections with neuroscience, underscoring the importance of understanding and controlling brain functions. I began my journey of brain exploration by recognizing its complexity and experiencing various methods to study it.

**Complexity in interneurons.** Since the time of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, neuron classification has remained a fundamental area of study in neurobiology. Today, we are empowered by various advanced tools that allow us to observe neurons in greater detail. We can examine their morphology to understand structural differences, study their physiology to learn about their functional properties, and analyze their molecular expression to uncover genetic and biochemical characteristics. These modern techniques enhance our ability to classify and understand the diverse types of neurons within the brain.

In our project focused on classifying VIP+ interneurons ([Shao-Na Jiang](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhac343), 2023. [Poster](https://zhouying0818.github.io/zying_blog/personal_doc/Poster_Sncg_Mybpc1_and_Parm1_Classify_subpopulations_of_VIP-expressing_interneurons%20_n_layers_23_of.pdf) ), I constructed quantification methods for analyzing the morphology and electrophysiology of neurons (Figure 1A-D) and employed various computational methods to analyze their subtypes (Figure 1F-G). During this research, I thoroughly recognized the complexity of neurons and generated a question: **What promotes them to form such complicated features?**

**Neural stem/progenitor cells possess the remarkable ability to generate the complex features of neurons and glia.** These cells undergo various stages of differentiation and specialization, giving rise to the diverse cell types that contribute to the intricate structure and function of the brain (Figure 2A). Understanding the mechanisms that guide their development is crucial for unraveling the complexities of neural architecture and addressing neurological disorders.

In my previous project on the development of the ferret’s gyrus ([Poster](https://zhouying0818.github.io/zying_blog/personal_doc/Poster_%20Effects_of_Cell_Cycle_and_migration_on_Cortical_Folding_During_Brain_Development_in_ferret.pdf)), I labeled types of neural stem/progenitor cells and analyzed their differentiation and cell cycle across the gyrus and sulcus regions. This work highlighted the remarkable power of neural progenitors, particularly an interesting subtype of radial glial cell (RGC) known as truncated RGC (tRG). Unlike other neural cells that migrate outward, tRGs truncate their basal process in particular developmental timeline (Figure 2B). This unique behavior fascinated me and underscored the diverse strategies neural progenitors employ during brain development.
